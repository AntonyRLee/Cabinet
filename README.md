It consists of:

+ Python control code to maintain specified temperature (C) and relative humidity (%RH) conditions
+ MySQL code to create the management databases for recording measurements from sensors
+ Theoretical considerations for the physics which governs the fluid dynamics of the air and temperature (Navier-Stokes equations)
