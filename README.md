This repository is a source for regulating the environment of a cabinet which will dry, cure and ferment food stuffs.
It consists of:

+ Python control code to maintain specified temperature (C) and relative humidity (%RH) conditions
+ MySQL code to create the management databases for recording measurements from sensors
+ Theoretical considerations for the physics which governs the fluid dynamics of the air and temperature (Navier-Stokes equations)

We are continually looking to improve every aspect of this repository: code, datebase, theory. 

Backgroud:

This is code for enthusiastic amateur food stuff curing methods. The control system was developed to dry cure meats but can work for any environment if hardware is capable

Initial testing of the code was for salumi and dry ageing meat products (pancetta, coppa, dry aged beef) and if you have another testing application in mind please get in contact. We would love to help design the whole 

The hope is that others can use this to develop their own low cost, yet highly productive, curing, drying and fermenting apparatus at home
